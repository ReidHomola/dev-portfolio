                As a dynamic software engineer with a proven track record, I
                swiftly adapt to new technologies and excel in various languages
                and frameworks. My passion for continuous learning drives me to
                stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.
                <br />
                <br />I bring a wealth of experience from the lumber and
                building materials industry, where I honed my skills working
                with ERP systems. I have developed robust analytics tools,
                integrated software solutions, and automated numerous manual
                tasks to enhance operational efficiency and data-driven
                decision-making.
