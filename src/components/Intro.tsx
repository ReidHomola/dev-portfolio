                I'm a software developer who genuinely cares about my craft and
                quality of my work. I do well transforming complex problems into
                elegant solutions. I take the time to develop with care and
                focus on finding the best solutions.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have a passion for learning. Ever since I was young I've
                absorbed many topics and technologies. I enjoy math, perfecting
                my disc golf skills, being with friends & family, and anything
                else that takes my fancy.
                <br />
                <br />I managed a small IT team where we maintained and improved
                our technical systems. Our team developed custom solutions to
                meet business needs including automations, analytics, and
                full-scale production applications.
